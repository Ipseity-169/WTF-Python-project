        "We wanted to build a project that encompasses all that we have been learning in class. We decided on a system that allows users to buy ticket for available upcoming concerts. On our system, users will be able to check for upcoming concerts, see if they are available, reserve a seat, get a discount if they enter the promo code and get a reciept for their purchase. Users can also decide the type of ticket they want, from the options available: Regular, VIP, VVIP and Table of Ten.\n",

We made use of our knowlege of loops, conditional statements, and dictionaries in order to make our code more concise and legible. Also, to catch and  handle exceptions in our code, we used 'try' and 'except' statements.\n",
